Using Stash, you can backup Kubernetes volumes mounted in following types of workloads:\n- Deployment\n- DaemonSet\n- ReplicaSet\n- ReplicationController\n- StatefulSet\n\n## Features\n - Fast, secure, efficient backup of Kubernetes [volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) (even in `ReadWriteOnce` mode).\n - Automates configuration of `restic` for periodic backup.\n - Store backed up files in various cloud storage provider, including S3, GCS, Azure, OpenStack Swift, DigitalOcean Spaces etc.\n - Restore backup easily.\n - Periodically check integrity of backed up data.\n - Take backup in offline mode.\n - Support workload initializer for faster backup.\n - Prometheus ready metrics for backup process.\n\n## Supported Versions\nPlease pick a version of Stash that matches your Kubernetes installation.\n\n| Stash Version                                                                       | Docs                                                            | Kubernetes Version |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| [v0.9.0-rc.0](https://github.com/stashed/stash/releases/tag/v0.9.0-rc.0) (uses CRD) | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.0)   | 1.11.x+            |\n| [0.8.3](https://github.com/stashed/stash/releases/tag/0.8.3) (uses CRD)             | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/stash/0.8.3)         | 1.9.x+             |\n| [0.7.0](https://github.com/stashed/stash/releases/tag/0.7.0) (uses CRD)             | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/stash/0.7.0)         | 1.8.x              |\n| [0.6.4](https://github.com/stashed/stash/releases/tag/0.6.4) (uses CRD)             | [User Guide](https://appscode.com/products/stash/0.6.4)         | 1.7.x              |\n| [0.4.2](https://github.com/stashed/stash/releases/tag/0.4.2) (uses TPR)             | [User Guide](https://github.com/stashed/docs/tree/0.4.2/docs)   | 1.5.x - 1.6.x      |\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install Stash, please follow the guide [here](https://appscode.com/products/stash/v0.9.0-rc.0/setup/install).\n\n## Using Stash\nWant to learn how to use Stash?
