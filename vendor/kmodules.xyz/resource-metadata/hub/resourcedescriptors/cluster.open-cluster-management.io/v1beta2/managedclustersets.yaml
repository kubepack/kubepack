        ManagedClusterSet defines a group of ManagedClusters that you can run
        workloads on. You can define a workload to be deployed on a ManagedClusterSet. See the following options  for the workload:
        - The workload can run on any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet
        - The workload cannot run on any ManagedCluster outside the ManagedClusterSet
        - The service exposed by the workload can be shared in any ManagedCluster in the ManagedClusterSet


        To assign a ManagedCluster to a certain ManagedClusterSet, add a label with the name cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset
        on the ManagedCluster to refer to the ManagedClusterSet. You are not
        allowed to add or remove this label on a ManagedCluster unless you have an
        RBAC rule to CREATE on a virtual subresource of managedclustersets/join.
        To update this label, you must have the permission on both
        the old and new ManagedClusterSet.
