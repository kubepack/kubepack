        ManagedClusterSetBinding projects a ManagedClusterSet into a certain namespace.
        You can create a ManagedClusterSetBinding in a namespace and bind it to a
        ManagedClusterSet if both have a RBAC rules to CREATE on the virtual subresource of managedclustersets/bind.
        Workloads that you create in the same namespace can only be distributed to ManagedClusters
        in ManagedClusterSets that are bound in this namespace by higher-level controllers.
