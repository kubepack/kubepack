        of managed cluster. ManagedCluster is a cluster scoped resource. The name
        is the cluster UID. \n The cluster join process follows a double opt-in process:
        \n 1. Agent on managed cluster creates CSR on hub with cluster UID and agent
        name. 2. Agent on managed cluster creates ManagedCluster on hub. 3. Cluster
        admin on hub approves the CSR for UID and agent name of the ManagedCluster.
        4. Cluster admin sets spec.acceptClient of ManagedCluster to true. 5. Cluster
        admin on managed cluster creates credential of kubeconfig to hub. \n Once
        the hub creates the cluster namespace, the Klusterlet agent on the ManagedCluster
        pushes the credential to the hub to use against the kube-apiserver of the
        ManagedCluster."
