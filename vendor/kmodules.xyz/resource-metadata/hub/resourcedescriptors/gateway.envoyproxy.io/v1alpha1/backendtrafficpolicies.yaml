                        associated limit is applied in a mutually exclusive way. If a request
                        matches multiple rules, each of their associated limits get applied, so a
                        single request might increase the rate limit counters for multiple rules
                        if selected. The rate limit service will return a logical OR of the individual
                        rate limit decisions of all matching rules. For example, if a request
                        matches two rules, one rate limited and one not, the final decision will be
                        to rate limit the request.
