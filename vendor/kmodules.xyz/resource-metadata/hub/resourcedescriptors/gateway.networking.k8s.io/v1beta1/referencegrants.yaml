        ReferenceGrant identifies kinds of resources in other namespaces that are
        trusted to reference the specified kinds of resources in the same namespace
        as the policy.


        Each ReferenceGrant can be used to represent a unique trust relationship.
        Additional Reference Grants can be used to add to the set of trusted
        sources of inbound references for the namespace they are defined within.


        All cross-namespace references in Gateway API (with the exception of cross-namespace
        Gateway-route attachment) require a ReferenceGrant.


        ReferenceGrant is a form of runtime verification allowing users to assert
        which cross-namespace object references are permitted. Implementations that
        support ReferenceGrant MUST NOT permit cross-namespace references which have
        no grant, and MUST respond to the removal of a grant by revoking the access
        that the grant allowed.
