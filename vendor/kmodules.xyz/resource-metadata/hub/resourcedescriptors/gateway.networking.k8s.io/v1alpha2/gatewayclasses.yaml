      description: "GatewayClass describes a class of Gateways available to the user
        for creating Gateway resources. \n It is recommended that this resource be
        used as a template for Gateways. This means that a Gateway is based on the
        state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to the GatewayClass
        or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing Gateways. This
        recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes to GatewayClass
        or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate GatewayClass
        changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented by the implementation.
        \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass, implementations
        SHOULD add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io` finalizer
        on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass associated
        with a Gateway is not deleted while in use. \n GatewayClass is a Cluster level
        resource."
