      description: AppliedManifestWork represents an applied manifestwork on managed
        cluster that is placed on a managed cluster. An AppliedManifestWork links
        to a manifestwork on a hub recording resources deployed in the managed cluster.
        When the agent is removed from managed cluster, cluster-admin on managed cluster
        can delete appliedmanifestwork to remove resources deployed by the agent.
        The name of the appliedmanifestwork must be in the format of {hash of hub's
        first kube-apiserver url}-{manifestwork name}
