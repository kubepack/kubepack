        ManagedProxyServiceResolver defines a target service that need to expose from a set of managed clusters to the hub.
        To access a target service on a managed cluster from hub. First, users need to apply a proper ManagedProxyServiceResolver.
        The managed cluster should match the ManagedClusterSet in the ManagedProxyServiceResolver.Spec. The serviceNamespace and serviceName should also match the target service.
        A usage example: /examples/access-other-services/main.go
