                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                              of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                    `replicas` is the expected replicas of the proxy servers.
                    Note that the replicas will also be reflected in the flag `--server-count`
                    so that agents can discover all the server instances.
