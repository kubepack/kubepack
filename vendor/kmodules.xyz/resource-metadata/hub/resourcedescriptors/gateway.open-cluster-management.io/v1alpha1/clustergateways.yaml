        ClusterGateway is an extension model for ManagedCluster which implements
        the Tier-II cluster model based on OCM's original abstraction of
        ManagedCluster. The Tier-II cluster model should be highly protected under
        RBAC policies and only the admin shall have the access to view the content
        of cluster credentials.
