            writeConnectionSecretToRef:
              description: WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace
                and name of a Secret to which any connection details for this managed
                resource should be written. Connection details frequently include
                the endpoint, username, and password required to connect to the managed
                resource. This field is planned to be replaced in a future release
                in favor of PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set
                independently and connection details would be published to both without
                affecting each other.
